Html:5 >> Boiler plate code 

Browsers have built in Javascript engines 

CDN - Content delivery Network
DOM - Document object model

react.development.js. >
 Core react file
react-dom.development.js. > 
to update dom in browserBridge between react core logic and browser

Render > converts the javascript object into html tag

EP-2

NPM   >  Does not have full form. 
Packages manager >> Registry that contains code packages

npm install >> to recreate node modules

npm install -D package name 

-D > Dev dependency (required for development phase)

Dev Dependency vs prod dependency

Package version : ^ - minor version upgrades
~ - Major version upgrade

Package.json >> configuration for npm
Package-lock.json >> Keeps record of every exact version of package/dependency

Integrity in package-lock.json >> hash to verify dev machine version and prod version is same

Transitive Dependencies >> package Depends on another package and that package depends on another

Package and package-lock should be committed to repo

Bundler > cleaned, cached, Minified,Bundled, Compressed code
Eg., Webpack, Parcel, Veet

Parcel:
	- Dev Build
	- Local Server
	- HMR - Hot Module replacement (when file saved automatically page refresh in browser) - Hot reloading
	- File Watching Algorithm- Written in c++
	- Caching- Faster Builds
	- Image Optimisation
	- Minification
	- Bundling
	- Compress
	- Consistent Hashing
	- Code Splitting
	- Differential Bundling - support older browsers
	- Diagnositics
	- Error Handling
	- HTTPS support in local
	- Tree Shaking - remove unused code
	- Different Dev and Production bundles


npx > executing a package


browserslist. >> can provide what are the browsers to support , can be country specific also

EP -3
React.CreateElement -> ReactElement JS-Object -> HTML Element(Render)
ReactDOM.CreateRoot > render to root


JSX -> extension of Javascript . (Not HTML in javascript)
JSK is HTML/XML like syntax

JSX code cannot be understood by JS Engine
JS engine understands only ECMA script . 
JSX uses camelcase

Babel transpires the JSX code to ECMA script for the browser.

React Components
	- Class Based Component – OLD
	- Functional Component - NEW - Javascript function . 
		It is a function that return a JSX code / React Element
ComponentVariable Name should start with Capital letter

Component composition > component inside component


EP-4

Props: passing arguments to a function

Config-Driven UI : Ui is config driven (e.g carousel should be vertical, carousel contents . If not carousel contents will not be displayed )

?.  > Optional chaining


EP-5

React is fast bcoz it efficient DOM manipulation. Bcoz it has a diff algorithm to  compare virtual DOM and update UI  
Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber): 
React 16 feature, whenever there is a change in UI

Virtual DOM- Representation of actual DOM (Javascript object)
Actual DOM - Tags like <Div>

Diff Algorithm: Find the diff between the virtual DOMs (old VDOM vs new VDOM)

Named Export > when multple exports from same file
React Hooks : normal javascript function given to us by React (utility function)

useState - state Variables in react
	//State Variable Creation
	const [listOfRestaurants] = useState()
	//Normal Variable Creation
	let istofRestaurants;

Whenever the state variable updates/changes., react will re-render the component
